# BatchGoogle
This application can generate Google Links of every combination of the combinations of two lists and their terms.

For example, if you have a list of countries and you want to match up a list of key terms about them such as population density and government type,
you can use this tool. If you were to enter such information, a long list of Google links would be generated with each country matched up to each
key term.
