# BatchGoogle
This application can generate Google Links of every combination of the combinations of two lists and their terms.

For example, if you have a list of countries and you want to match up a list of key terms about them such as population density and government type,
you can use this tool. If you were to enter such information, a long list of Google links would be generated with each country matched up to each
key term.
Example:
List 1: France, America, Germany
List 2: Agricultural Density, Population
Output:

https://www.google.com/search?q=France+Agricultural+Density

https://www.google.com/search?q=France+Population

https://www.google.com/search?q=America+Agricultural+Density

https://www.google.com/search?q=America+Population

https://www.google.com/search?q=Germany+Agricultural+Density

https://www.google.com/search?q=Germany+Population

So it outputs all the combinations of each combination as stated before.

This is not the only use case, just the one I could come up with. It is very useful for batch Google search operations, but not small operations
since you might as well type what you need in Google. But in the case of hundreds of words that need matching, this will help you work efficiently.

I plan to turn this into a webpage that can also scrape the top search result for answers if Google doesn't present it right away. The webpage will have a nice design and animations for the buttons using CSS.
This conversion will take a while (months) since I barely know web development but I will learn quite a few important things from it. Maybe I can also put the page
online and see if I can get it to show up on Google with SEO to target people's needs. I would end up adding advertisements for revenue but it's a good start.
